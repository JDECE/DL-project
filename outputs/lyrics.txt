this is our christmas night
snow is white
the eyes and squeezed the sky
at the edge of your children were going
before watching the gate
one of the latest fox
little christmas eve
when are you wearing a band
i live with bankruptcy
don't forget my little use
before we go
he'll have to look up it well
you'll get cold if you don't feel
it's a little of me
he gets up as a shower so i often showed up
to see you so much for me
all i think that my children are studying
what i have to wait
little christmas eve
when are you wearing a band
i live with bankruptcy
don't forget my little use
the light went out of order
children go to bed
and then we'll start
on your back
at the u s them is
your suggestion is high
little christmas eve
when are you wearing a band
i live with bankruptcy
don't forget my little use
when will you be your age to make your health
come here in our house
i don't have very often at all
where sorry but i ask
little christmas eve
when are you wearing a band
i live with bankruptcy
don't forget my little use
before we go
he'll have to look up it well
you'll get cold if you don't feel
it's a little of me
